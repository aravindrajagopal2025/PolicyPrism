# Specification Quality Checklist: Policy Warehouse

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (2 markers present - see notes)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Clarification Markers (2 total)

1. **FR-013**: Which payers should be supported initially? Should scraping be configurable per-payer?
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects initial scope and architecture flexibility
   - **Recommendation**: Start with 2-3 major payers (Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna) with configurable per-payer scraping to allow expansion

2. **FR-015**: Should failed documents be automatically retried, or require manual intervention?
   - **Impact**: Low - affects operational workflow but not core functionality
   - **Recommendation**: Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts), then flag for manual review

### Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… Specification is high quality and ready for planning

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with 4 independent user stories (P1-P4)
- Each story has well-defined acceptance criteria and independent test descriptions
- Comprehensive edge cases identified (8 scenarios)
- 15 functional requirements with clear MUST statements
- 6 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Well-defined key entities (6 entities with attributes)

**Minor Issues**:
- 2 clarification markers remain (within acceptable limit of 3)
- Both clarifications have reasonable defaults that can be applied

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` to resolve the 2 clarification markers, or proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` using the recommended defaults noted above.
