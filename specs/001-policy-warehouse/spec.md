# Feature Specification: Policy Warehouse

**Feature Branch**: `001-policy-warehouse`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a policy warehouse that will be built by scraping medical/pharma policy documents from Payers (e.g. Cigna) and an agentic AI framework (LLM) will convert the unstructured policy documents (*.pdf) to structured, relational format."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-24

- Q: Initial payer scope - which payers should be supported initially and should scraping be configurable per-payer? → A: Start with Cigna only, expand incrementally based on extraction accuracy
- Q: Processing failure retry strategy - should failed documents be automatically retried or require manual intervention? → A: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts), then flag for manual review
- Q: User access control - what level of authentication and authorization is required? → A: Role-based access with read-only analysts and admin users who can upload/configure
- Q: Data retention and versioning policy - how long should historical policy versions be retained? → A: Retain all historical versions indefinitely with soft-delete capability
- Q: LLM extraction validation workflow - what level of human validation is required for extracted policy data? → A: Human-in-the-loop validation for first N policies per payer, then confidence-based sampling

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Ingest Policy Documents (Priority: P1)

As a healthcare analyst, I need to add new payer policy documents to the warehouse so that they become available for querying and analysis in structured format.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability - without document ingestion and structuring, no other functionality is possible. It represents the core value proposition of converting unstructured PDFs to structured data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a sample payer policy PDF (e.g., Cigna medical policy), verifying the system extracts and structures the content, and confirming the structured data is stored and retrievable. Delivers immediate value by making one policy searchable and queryable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid payer policy PDF document, **When** I upload it to the system, **Then** the document is accepted, queued for processing, and I receive a confirmation with a tracking identifier
2. **Given** a policy document is being processed, **When** I check its status, **Then** I see the current processing stage (e.g., "extracting text", "structuring data", "complete")
3. **Given** a policy document has been successfully processed, **When** I view its structured data, **Then** I see extracted entities like policy name, effective dates, coverage criteria, exclusions, and requirements organized in a queryable format
4. **Given** a corrupted or invalid PDF, **When** I attempt to upload it, **Then** the system rejects it with a clear error message explaining the issue

### User Story 2 - Search and Query Policies (Priority: P2)

As a healthcare analyst, I need to search across all ingested policies to find specific coverage criteria, requirements, or exclusions so that I can quickly answer coverage questions without manually reading PDFs.

**Why this priority**: Once policies are structured, the primary user value is being able to search and query them efficiently. This transforms the warehouse from a data store into a useful tool for decision-making.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by pre-loading a few structured policies and verifying users can search by keywords, filter by payer/date/policy type, and retrieve relevant policy sections. Delivers value by enabling fast policy lookups.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple policies are stored in the warehouse, **When** I search for a specific term (e.g., "prior authorization"), **Then** I see all policies containing that term with relevant context highlighted
2. **Given** I want to narrow my search, **When** I apply filters (payer name, effective date range, policy type), **Then** results are filtered accordingly
3. **Given** a search returns multiple results, **When** I view a result, **Then** I see the policy metadata, the relevant section containing my search term, and links to related policy sections
4. **Given** no policies match my search criteria, **When** I execute the search, **Then** I see a clear "no results" message with suggestions for broadening the search

---

### User Story 3 - Compare Policies Across Payers (Priority: P3)

As a healthcare analyst, I need to compare how different payers handle the same medical procedure or condition so that I can identify coverage variations and make informed recommendations.

**Why this priority**: This builds on the search capability to provide comparative analysis - a higher-value use case that requires multiple policies to be ingested and structured first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by selecting a specific topic (e.g., "knee replacement surgery") and comparing coverage criteria across 2-3 different payers. Delivers value by surfacing policy differences that would otherwise require manual cross-referencing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have selected a medical procedure or condition, **When** I request a comparison across payers, **Then** I see a side-by-side view of coverage criteria, requirements, and exclusions from each payer
2. **Given** policies have different structures, **When** viewing the comparison, **Then** the system aligns comparable sections (e.g., all "prior authorization" requirements together) for easy comparison
3. **Given** a comparison is displayed, **When** I identify a significant difference, **Then** I can export or save the comparison for reporting purposes
4. **Given** some payers don't have policies for the selected topic, **When** viewing the comparison, **Then** those payers are clearly marked as "no policy found" rather than showing empty data

---

### User Story 4 - Bulk Policy Scraping (Priority: P4)

As a system administrator, I need to automatically scrape and ingest policy documents from payer websites on a scheduled basis so that the warehouse stays current without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Automation is important for long-term maintenance but not critical for initial value delivery. Manual uploads (P1) can sustain the system while scraping is developed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a scraper for one payer website, running it, and verifying new/updated policies are automatically ingested. Delivers value by reducing manual maintenance effort.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a payer website URL and scraping configuration, **When** I schedule a scraping job, **Then** the system periodically checks for new or updated policy documents
2. **Given** new policy documents are found, **When** the scraper runs, **Then** documents are automatically downloaded and queued for processing
3. **Given** a policy document already exists in the warehouse, **When** an updated version is found, **Then** the system creates a new version while preserving the historical version
4. **Given** a scraping job fails (e.g., website structure changed), **When** I check job status, **Then** I see a clear error message and the system alerts me for manual intervention

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a PDF is scanned (image-based) rather than text-based?
- How does the system handle multi-language policies or policies with mixed languages?
- What happens when a policy document references external documents or appendices?
- How does the system handle extremely large policy documents (500+ pages)?
- What happens when two policies have conflicting effective dates or coverage criteria?
- How does the system handle policy documents with complex tables, charts, or diagrams?
- What happens when a payer website requires authentication or has anti-scraping measures?
- How does the system handle policy updates vs. entirely new policies with similar names?
